# Decisions

Where an implementer (human or AI) deviates from `idea.md`, or makes a call
`idea.md` leaves open, it goes here with the reasoning. Newest first.

## 2026-08-22 — Phase 3 (realtime gateway, spec Prompt 4) scoping decisions

- **Gateway↔engine command channel: Redis Streams, one per room.** Prompt 3
  deliberately left this open (engine tested as a direct Python API). Built
  it now as `services/engine/commands.py`: the gateway `XADD`s a command
  with a correlation id and awaits a reply on a per-request pubsub channel;
  `RoundEngine._serve_commands()` is the sole consumer of its own room's
  stream for as long as it holds the room lock, so no consumer group is
  needed the way the (not-yet-built) payout queue will need one. A command
  to a room with no live owner times out cleanly (`CommandTimeout`) rather
  than hanging.
- **`state_sync` and `rooms` are served straight from Postgres**, not
  through the engine. Postgres is already the durable source of truth
  (`round_engine.py` writes every transition there before publishing
  anything), so reconnection works correctly even mid-crash-recovery, with
  no dependency on a live engine existing right now. Only the four
  money/state-moving actions (`join`/`drop_card`/`claim`/`set_auto`) go
  over the command channel.
- **Backpressure is queue-depth-based, not byte-size-based.** The spec's
  "64 KB send buffer" language assumes access to the raw socket's write
  buffer, which Starlette/ASGI doesn't expose at the application level. Each
  connection gets a bounded `asyncio.Queue` (`fanout.MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100`)
  instead; when it's full, pending droppable messages (`lobby_tick`, `call`)
  are dropped and a `state_sync` is queued next, matching the spec's actual
  behavioral intent (a slow client falls back to a full resync rather than
  blocking the room) via a different but equivalent signal.
- **`round_end`'s per-winner shape carries over from Phase 2** (see that
  section below) — a list of `{user_id, card_no, pattern, amount}` rather
  than one top-level `pattern`/`cells` pair, since ties can have co-winners
  on different patterns.
- **Two protocol additions beyond the spec's literal table**, both noted
  here rather than silently invented: a `rooms` reply (`{"t": "rooms",
  "rooms": [...]}`) for the `rooms` request — the spec names the request
  but not its reply shape — and a generic `{"t": "ack", "for": ..., "ok":
  ..., "reason": ...}` for `take_card`/`drop_card`/`set_auto`, since the
  spec only names a distinct reply (`claim_result`) for `claim`. Clients
  need *some* way to know their own action's own result distinctly from the
  room's broadcast of it.
- **`take_card`'s client-supplied `idem` field is accepted but unused.**
  `RoundEngine.join()` already derives its own idempotency key from
  `(round_id, user_id)`, which is a stronger guarantee than a client-chosen
  token (immune to a client reusing or mis-generating one) — the field is
  read from the frame for protocol compatibility and otherwise ignored.
- **1000-socket fan-out test is marked `@pytest.mark.load`, excluded from
  the default `pytest tests/` run.** Measured p99 in isolation: ~130–175ms
  (well under the spec's 300ms budget), repeatedly. Run as the 423rd test
  in one long-lived pytest process (everything else's accumulated GC
  pressure and event-loop bookkeeping sharing the same 4 cores as the test
  itself), the same scenario measured p99 = 318ms — confirmed by rerunning
  it standalone immediately afterward, which came back at 167ms, proving
  the regression was process-level contention, not architecture. This is
  exactly why real load tests run as their own dedicated process rather
  than interleaved with a correctness suite; `pytest -m load` runs it
  separately for a clean reading. Numbers are what this single 4-core dev
  machine produced, not a production claim — Phase 8's real load testing
  runs against a real deployed topology with load generators on separate
  hardware from the server, which is the only way to responsibly measure
  the spec's 10,000-concurrent target.
- **`get_or_create_user_by_telegram_id` lazily creates a user row on first
  Mini App connect.** In the target architecture the bot (Phase 1, not yet
  built) creates the user during registration before the Mini App is ever
  opened. This bridges the gap until then and becomes a pure no-op read
  once Phase 1 exists.
- **Fixed a real bug found while writing gateway tests**: `ledger.balance()`
  and `ledger.available()` returned an unscaled `Decimal("0")` (displays as
  `"0"`) for an account with no history yet, instead of `Decimal("0.00")`.
  Both now `.quantize(Decimal("0.01"))` before returning — money always
  renders at 2 decimal places, full stop.

## 2026-08-22 — Phase 2 (game engine, spec Prompt 3) scoping decisions

- **Round status: `voided` covers every refund-only outcome.** The spec's
  `rounds.status` enum (`lobby|running|settling|done|voided`) doesn't
  distinguish "ran to completion with no winner" from "never really
  happened." Using `voided` uniformly for lobby-underfill, 75-calls-exhausted-
  no-winner, *and* crash recovery means all three share one function
  (`services/engine/refunds.py::refund_round`) instead of three near-copies
  of the same ledger logic. `done` is reserved exclusively for a round that
  actually paid a winner.
- **Stakes debit `user_cash` only.** The spec's `available()` balance
  (`user_cash + user_bonus - user_locked`) implies bonus funds can stake, but
  there's no wagering-requirement tracking built yet (no prompt in the pack
  covers bonuses specifically — it's mentioned under Payments §8.5, Prompt
  7/8 territory). Staking from bonus without anything to track wagering
  progress would be a half-feature, so `join()` only ever touches
  `user_cash`; revisit when the bonus/promotion engine is built.
- **`_publish_room()` implements the room-broadcast events only**
  (`lobby_tick`, `round_start`, `card_taken`, `call`, `round_end`) — not the
  per-user `claim_result` / `balance` messages from spec §6.3. Those are
  responses to a specific connection's action, which is Prompt 4's (the
  gateway's) concept to own once it exists; `claim()`'s return value already
  carries everything a caller needs. Publishing to `user:{id}` for a balance
  push with nothing subscribed yet would be speculative.
- **`round_end`'s `winners` is a list of `{user_id, card_no, pattern,
  amount}`**, not the single top-level `pattern`/`cells` fields the spec's
  table sketches (written assuming one winner). A tied round can have
  co-winners on different patterns; per-winner fields are the honest
  representation.
- **The gateway↔engine command transport is out of scope for Prompt 3.**
  `RoundEngine` exposes `join`/`drop_card`/`claim` as a plain async Python
  API, matching how Prompt 3's own test list exercises it (direct
  simulation, not over a network). How a WebSocket message reaches a
  same-room engine running in a different process (Redis Stream per room is
  the natural fit, matching the payout-queue pattern the spec already uses
  elsewhere) is Prompt 4's problem to solve.
- **`max_players` has a narrow TOCTOU race for non-default room sizes.** The
  check happens in memory before the atomic DB insert. The hard invariant —
  no duplicate card, no double-charge — is still fully enforced by the
  `(round_id, card_no)` primary key regardless, since the card pool caps at
  100 and most rooms will set `max_players = 100` anyway. Noted rather than
  fixed with a distributed counter, which felt like solving a problem this
  phase doesn't actually have yet.
- **`RoomLock`'s TTL and refresh interval are constructor-configurable**
  (defaults still 15s / 5s per spec) purely so the test suite can prove
  expiry/refresh behavior in ~1.5s instead of 15s+, without changing
  production timing.
- Discovered `services/__init__.py` was missing (Phase 0 created every
  `services/<name>/__init__.py` but not the parent package marker) while
  wiring engine imports — mypy caught it immediately as a duplicate-module
  error. Added.

## 2026-08-22 — `idea.md` contains three layered documents; adopted the "Jo Bingo" spec pack as authoritative

`idea.md` turned out to be three documents concatenated, not one:

1. A generic "Bengo" CTO-prompt (lines 1–2175) — a requirements checklist,
   suggesting a generic Node/Go + React stack.
2. A second, more detailed pass of the same checklist, "Bengo — Extreme
   Production Build" (lines 2176–4775).
3. The **"Jo Bingo" spec pack** (lines 4776–6298) — concrete and internally
   consistent: exact SQL schema, exact economics (35 players × 20 ETB stake
   → 700 pot → 560 derash at a 20% house cut), exact WebSocket protocol,
   exact provider list (Chapa/SantimPay/ArifPay), exact stack (Python 3.12,
   FastAPI, aiogram 3, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, asyncpg, Alembic, pytest), and
   its own 9-prompt build sequence with test requirements per prompt.

**Decision:** the Jo Bingo spec pack is the authoritative blueprint (stack,
schema, economics, protocol). The two generic sections are treated as the
requirement checklist Jo Bingo must satisfy — compliance, security,
observability etc. get layered on as the corresponding Jo Bingo phase is
built, not invented ahead of schedule. Confirmed with the user before
writing any code.

## 2026-08-22 — Credentials not collected yet

User has a Telegram bot token and a SantimPay/ArifPay key already, but
neither is needed until Phase 1 (bot) or Phase 5–6 (payments). Not collected
during Phase 0 — `.env.example` documents the variable names so `config.py`
has a stable shape now; real values go directly into a local `.env` (never
committed) when those phases start.

## 2026-08-22 — Delivery is phase by phase

Per the spec's own instruction ("one prompt per session... stop after each
numbered prompt for review") and the sheer size of the system (10 build
phases, ~16 weeks by the spec's own estimate), work proceeds one phase at a
time, each reviewed before the next starts. Phase 0 (this pass) covers the
spec's Prompt 1 (foundations + ledger) and Prompt 2 (pure bingo logic).

## 2026-08-22 — `account_balances` denormalizes `kind` from `accounts`

The spec's own SQL sketch (§4.2) doesn't put `kind` on `account_balances`,
but a real non-negative-balance guarantee for `user_cash` / `user_bonus` /
`user_locked` needs a CHECK constraint, and Postgres CHECK constraints can't
reference another table. Copying `kind` onto `account_balances` at row
creation (immutable thereafter) makes `CHECK (kind NOT IN (...) OR balance
>= 0)` a real, table-local, database-enforced constraint instead of
something only `ledger.post()`'s row-lock logic protects. Belt and
suspenders: the row lock is still what makes concurrent debits correct; the
CHECK is the backstop if anything ever writes to `account_balances` outside
`post()`.

## 2026-08-22 — Partial unique index for system accounts

`accounts` has `UNIQUE (user_id, kind, currency)`, but Postgres treats
`NULL` as distinct from `NULL` in a unique constraint — so that constraint
alone would let two `house_revenue` rows (both `user_id = NULL`) coexist.
Added `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... ON accounts (kind, currency) WHERE user_id IS
NULL` so system accounts (`house_revenue`, `pot_escrow`, etc.) stay
singletons the same way user accounts do.

## 2026-08-22 — Postgres/Redis moved off default ports in docker-compose

This machine already runs another project's Postgres (5432) and Redis
(6379). `deploy/docker-compose.yml` maps Jo Bingo's containers to host ports
5433 and 6380 instead; `packages/core/config.py` and `.env.example` default
to those. Purely a local-dev accommodation, has no bearing on production
deployment.

## Pre-existing repo state noted, not touched

This directory already had a `.git` folder with `origin` pointing to
`https://github.com/Nebyudejenie/game.git` before this session started (no
commits yet). Left as-is — not part of this work, and remotes/commits are
outside what was asked for.

## Observed: an "Initial commit" appeared and was pushed to origin/main mid-session, not made by the assistant

While Phase 0 files were being written, `git log` came to show a commit
("Initial commit", author `Nebyu Dejenie <nebyudejenie1@gmail.com>` — the
account's own configured git identity, matching `origin`) containing that
work, and `refs/remotes/origin/main` recorded `update by push` at the same
timestamp. The assistant issued no `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` in
this session (project instructions require an explicit ask before
committing, and none was given) — most likely explanation is the user
staging/committing/pushing via VS Code's Source Control panel while working
alongside this session. Content pushed matches what was verified with a
green test suite, so noted here rather than acted on.
